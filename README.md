# Description of the backend and frontend structure

# Backend:-

    I created backend in node js the user can ask for create or delete or update or getting all task etc..
    This backend is pushed to github and from there to it went to production in (render website)

    So here is url you can access backend repo here :-  https://github.com/Chaithanya984/backend-assignment-oritso

# Frontend:-

    I created frontend in react js and the user has login and signup only auth user can manage tasks like
        * create
        * delete
        * update
        * add task
    And i pushed frontend in github and here is the repo url:- https://github.com/Chaithanya984/frontend-assignment-oritso

    Due to some errors in production i can't upload both at one place so please check it

    And i published the frontend in versel and here is the link:- https://frontend-assignment-oritso.vercel.app/

# Setup instructions, including environment and dependency installation

    first type npm install and then you can start as npm start

# Testing instructions and results

All test have done like input required field and add task and delete task and auth user login and signup etc..

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# backend public production url and frontend

    backend :- "https://backend-assignment-oritso.onrender.com/"
    frontend:- "https://frontend-assignment-oritso.vercel.app/"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
